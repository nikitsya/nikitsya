# I'm Nikita Smiichyk 🪽

Software Development student (QQI Level 8) based in Dundalk, Ireland. 
I build backend-oriented applications and structured systems, with a strong focus on clean architecture, business logic, and maintainability.

## What I Build

Examples of projects and directions on my GitHub:

### Stripe-likeBillingPlatform
A Java project inspired by billing and payment systems, built to explore OOP design and finance-style business logic.

### Opticube
A CSS-centric project focused on UI structure, layout consistency, and scalable style organization.

### Supermarket Store System (this repository)
A Java-based backend learning project focused on:
- Product domain modeling with validation rules
- DAO interfaces and JDBC-oriented architecture
- SQL schema setup and relational structure (products/departments)
- Clean separation between domain, data access, and conversion layers

This project is currently in progress and used to practice practical backend architecture decisions.

## Tech Stack

### Languages
Java, Python, C++, SQL, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, Kotlin

### Frameworks and Tools
React, Node.js, MySQL, Git

I use Git and version control in all projects, with a focus on consistent commit history and structured development.

## What I Care About

- Clean, maintainable code
- Object-oriented design and system structure
- Backend logic and data flow
- Long-term readability and maintainability

I enjoy turning complex logic into clear architecture and understandable systems.

## Where I'm Headed

I am developing toward backend engineering roles, especially in financial systems, clean architecture, and scalable backend services.
